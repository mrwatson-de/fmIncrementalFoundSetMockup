# fmIncrementalFoundSetMockup

The FileMaker Found-Set is at the heart of everything we do in FileMaker. => So let's give it a massive boost!

Wouldn't it be great if you could incrementally click a found set together in FileMaker (without leaving browse mode!), ... and the sort order column-for-column too?!

Here's a mockup of what it could be like.

Open and Enjoy

More coming soon.
